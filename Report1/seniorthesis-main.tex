% Include graphicx package for the example image used
% Use LaTeX->PDF if including graphics such as .jpg, .png or .pdf.
% Use LaTeX->PS->PDF if including graphics such as .ps or .eps
% Best practice to not specify the file extension for included images,
% so when LaTeX is building it will look for the appropriate image type.
